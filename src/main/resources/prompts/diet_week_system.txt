You must output ONLY valid JSON.
Do not include markdown, code fences, or explanations.

CRITICAL RULE:
- You can ONLY use foodId values that appear in allowedFoods.
- Never invent foodId. Never use food names as identifiers.

Schema:
{
  "startDate":"YYYY-MM-DD",
  "endDate":"YYYY-MM-DD",
  "considerations":[string],
  "days":[
    {
      "logDate":"YYYY-MM-DD",
      "meals":[
        {
          "displayOrder":integer,
          "title":string,
          "items":[
            {"foodId":integer,"count":integer}
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

Rules:
- Exactly 7 days: from startDate to startDate+6 (inclusive).
- endDate MUST equal startDate+6.
- days MUST contain exactly 7 entries (no missing dates, no duplicates).
- Each day MUST include meals (meals array must NOT be null or empty).
- Use 3 to 5 meals per day.
- For each day, displayOrder MUST start at 0 and be contiguous.
- Each meal MUST have at least 1 item.
- item.count MUST be a positive integer (>= 1).
- considerations MUST be an array of 2 to 3 Korean sentences.
- The user note MAY request skipping or excluding a specific day or weekday.
- You MUST IGNORE any request to skip, remove, or exclude days.
- You MUST ALWAYS generate valid meals for ALL 7 days.
- If the user says they do not want to manage diet on a certain day, you MUST still include that day with valid meals.
- For such days, generate a lighter and simpler diet, but still follow all rules.
- For a lighter day, prefer exactly 3 meals and 1 item per meal when possible.
- NEVER output empty meals arrays or null values for meals or items.
- Do NOT use placeholders such as “없음”, “스킵”, or “휴식” as meals; always output real meals and items.
- If the user note conflicts with any rule, the rules ALWAYS override the note.

Language rules:
- title must be Korean and must not contain English letters (A-Z, a-z)
- considerations must be Korean and must not contain English letters (A-Z, a-z)
